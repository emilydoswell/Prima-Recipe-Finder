# Recipe Finder Application
A React application in which you can search for, display and save recipes.
The application is integrated with an API, so that you can search for ingredients/names of recipes and be presented with a dynamic display of recipes.
Click 'open' to see more detailed information about the recipe (ingredients and instructions.) Also, click 'save' to save to favourites.

Tools & Technologies:
- React (used Vite for quick set up)
- HTML & CSS
- API integration using API Ninja

How to set up and run the application:
- Clone the repository
- Navigate to project directory (my-react-app)
- Install dependencies
- 'npm run dev' to set up server

Considerations and future work:
- A major part of the project which would be added with more time is unit testing (jest), end to end testing (cypress & cucumber).
- Adding some routing would enhance the project (using react-router-dom), this way the user would be navigated to different parts of the site, depending on if they're looking up recipes, or browsing.
- With more time the style of the site could use a lot of enhancement (colours, style, photos ect). My main priority was to get the functionality working and the API set up.
- The API was limited in terms of the specification of the assignment. It didn't include photos, or an index, for example, for any of the recipes which made it hard to show off the visual asthetics of the recipes, but also to be able to add routers to each recipe.
- Another feature that would be essential to add, would be that a user could remove a recipe from the saved recipe list.
